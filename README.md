# AndroidWearDemo
This demo was created for an Android Wear tutorial which can be found on Crittercism’s site here: http://www.crittercism.com/how-to-build-an-android-wear-app

## About the project
There are two main components, an Android Phone app and a Wear Module. The phone app gathers the user’s location, which then is sent to the watch for display on the user’s wrist. It’s short and sweet, but gets you exposed to how Android Wear works, and you walk away with a fully-functional app!

## See it in action
We have a video recording from our [Office Hours](http://www.crittercism.com/office-hours) that shows the app running and also gives an overview of the code. You can find it on YouTube [here](https://youtu.be/S9pOJgG9BzY).
